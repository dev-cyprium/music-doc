# About
Music dock is a rails social network all about music!
You can discuss/share/post about your favorite music, meet people that listen the same music as you and much more!
You can check the live version of this website on [heroku](https://music-dock.herokuapp.com/).
Also, you can learn web development for free at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/), an open source online curriculum that inspired me to make this as a project.

Disclaimer: This is an open source project inspired by Twitter, facebook and other social websites.
